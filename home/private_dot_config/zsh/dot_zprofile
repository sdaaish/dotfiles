# This file, $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile, is read after the global /etc/zsh/zprofile.
# It is read after /etc/zsh/zshenv and .zshenv.

# This will be read if it is a login shell, and only then.
# Put interactive stuff in .zshrc instead and only add the non-interactive to this file.

# A login shell will read this plus .zshrc, a non-interactive only .zshrc
